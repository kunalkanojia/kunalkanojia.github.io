I work at a startup in Singapore. We are 3 scala developers building distributed scalable application for our client.

I am senior full stack developer with experience in building high availability & low latency apps.

Spent most of my career coding in Java but for last couple of years I have been coding in Scala and loving it. 
I also hope to learn haskell soon.
