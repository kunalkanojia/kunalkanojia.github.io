Hi, in this series of post we'll create an event-sourced application from ground up. The application is going to be a over-simplified trade manager where a user can login, create trades and edit trades. In a way its our usual CRUD application with trade as our domain, but we will implement it using event sourcing. 

### Event Sourcing

What do we mean by event sourcing?
 
This is how Martin Fowler defines it -
<div class="message"> Event Sourcing ensures that all changes to application state are stored as a sequence of events. Not just can we query these events, we can also use the event log to reconstruct past states, and as a foundation to automatically adjust the state to cope with retroactive changes. </div>

What are events?

Events are immutable facts that are only ever appended to an event log which allows for very high transaction rates and efficient replication. 

Following the above definitions our application is going to store application state as a sequence of events. These events will be persisted in an event log ([Level DB](http://leveldb.org/)) and will be replayed on restart to recover application state. 

This is very different from the CRUD model most of us are used to building. A lot has been spoken about the pros and cons of each of these models so I'll not go into that. I have shared some links in the end where you can read more.


### Eventuate

> Eventuate is a toolkit for building applications composed of event-driven and event-sourced services that collaborate by exchanging events over shared event logs. Services can either be co-located on a single node or distributed up to global scale.

Eventuate provides several abstractions for building event sourced application components. We will be using two of those [EventSourcedView](http://rbmhtechnology.github.io/eventuate/reference/event-sourcing.html#event-sourced-views) and [EventSourcedActor](http://rbmhtechnology.github.io/eventuate/user-guide.html#event-sourced-actors).

We will see how easy it is to implement asynchronous event-sourced app with Play and eventuate. We just need to implement our events and domains, persistence and replaying of events will be taken care by eventuate provided actors.

But what about Akka Persistence?

Eventuate is very similar to akka persistence and I could have used it as well. Maybe in another post I'll change this to use AP and then compare it with eventuate implementation.
For now read here how they compare here - [Martins Blog](http://krasserm.github.io/2015/05/25/akka-persistence-eventuate-comparison/)

_Another good thing I would like to point out about eventuate is - Martin and his team are very helpful. You will always see quick response from Martin to any questions or problems on the eventuate gitter channel._


### tl;dr
If you are don't want to read more and dive straight into the code, then grab it here - [GitHub](https://github.com/kunalkanojia/react-play-eventsourcing )


### Architecture Overview 

The architecture of the application will look like this:

{% include image.html url="/images/architecture.png" style="text-align: center;" description="Its our standard architecture, but with one change. We have replaced ORM with Eventuate." %}


A user request is received by Play framework controller which then fires a Command to Eventuate actors. The persistent actor will persist event to the event log and respond with success or failure message. 

This whole cycle will be completely non blocking and event driven. We will soon see how.


### Sequence 

The basic flow of our application is going to be this:
 
1. Controller receives a request from UI

2. Controller will send data to service.

3. Service will then send a Command to a Manager. This manager will be a [EventSourcedView](http://rbmhtechnology.github.io/eventuate/reference/event-sourcing.html#event-sourced-views).

4. Manager will delegate the persistence commands to the persistent actor which are an instance of [EventSourcedActor](http://rbmhtechnology.github.io/eventuate/reference/event-sourcing.html#event-sourced-actors).

5. Depending on successful persistence the persistent actor will send a success or a failure response. It also informs the manager asynchronously to update its state so that retrieval can be done form the Manager.

<strong>Model</strong>

We are going to have a very simple trade model.

<script src="https://gist.github.com/kunalkanojia/664ec1bbbbbfb990c4b9f896711c073b.js"></script>

<strong>Trade Commands, Replies & Events</strong>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/kunalkanojia/9e716281e2136e0677e7517269b35053.js"></script>

For example, When user creates a trade form the UI.

A `CreateTrade` command is sent to the Actor which will persist a `TradeCreated` event to the event log and respond with `CreateTradeSuccess`.

### Actor system

If you don't know much about akka and the actor system, you can read here [http://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/2.4.7/general/actor-systems.html](http://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/2.4.7/general/actor-systems.html)

The actor system hierarchy for our app will be structured like below: 

{% include image.html url="/images/actor_system.png" style="text-align: center;" %}

Below is the description of what role each actor plays in the system.

_UserManager_ :
Extends from [EventSourcedView](http://rbmhtechnology.github.io/eventuate/architecture.html#event-sourced-views). One per system. Created when the application starts. Stores all users in memory and routes all create and read message to respective UserActor.

_UserActor_ :
Extends from [EventSourcedActor](http://rbmhtechnology.github.io/eventuate/user-guide.html#event-sourced-actors). One per user in the system. Created when a user signs up. Persists user events to the event log.

_TradeManager_ :
 Extends from [EventSourcedView](http://rbmhtechnology.github.io/eventuate/architecture.html#event-sourced-views). One per user in the system. Created by the UserActor when user signs up. Stores all trades for a particular user in memory. Routes all trade create and update message to respective trade actor.

_TradeActor_ :
Extends from [EventSourcedActor](http://rbmhtechnology.github.io/eventuate/user-guide.html#event-sourced-actors). One per trade. Created by trade manager when trade create command is received. Receives all trade create and update commands from the TradeManager and persists to the event log.

_TradeViewAggregateActor_ :
Extends from [EventSourcedView](http://rbmhtechnology.github.io/eventuate/architecture.html#event-sourced-views). One per system. Created on application startup. Receives command from all trade actors irrespective of the user and sends message to connected Web Socket user actors.


### Whats Next

We will follow TDD and start implementing our application. 

Terms above which you didn't understand will start making sense.

This should also give you a good idea on how to test asynchronous apps written using akka.
